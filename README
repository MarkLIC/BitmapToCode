This project offers a simple bitmap drawing mechanism and a simple JavaScript
API to access the bitmap data.

This can be used to make simple drawings and then generate code based on the
drawing.  One example of use would be to output code to re-generate the same
image that can be pasted into a source file in a language that you want to
target.

To build, load BitmapToCode.sln in VS2010.  This project depends on the .NET 4
framework.

If you come up with any useful presets, fork the code and make a pull request!
